# Advanced Topics in Interactive Audio

Instructor: [Charlie Roberts](http://charlie-roberts.com)
Office Hours: Tuesdays, 3-5 PM, Fuller Labs B30

## Course Description

(from the undergraduate catalog, emphases added by instructor)  
> This course provides students the opportunity to gain hands-on proficiency with the complete audio development pipeline for interactive applications, from concept and asset creation to post-production and integration. Topics may include custom recording techniques; *procedural audio generation*; *audio object states and conditions*; asset management; automated effects processing; and *spatial presentation of audio in stereo, surround and mixed/virtual reality formats*

We'll be looking at interactive audio less from the perspective of asset creation of more from the perspective of procedural generation in this class. And more importantly, we'll be emphasizing the *interactive* component, where audio isn't simply static assets to be triggered by some gameplay state, but is a critical part of interactive experiences (games or otherwise). The course will begin with experiments in [live coding](https://slab.org/2013/06/20/what-on-earth-is-live-coding/) as a vehicle for understanding and appreciating algorithmic transformation of sound; we'll be using the live coding environment [gibber](https://gibber.cc/playground) for this as a way to begin understanding audio on the web. After further studies of interaction using the Web Audio API and popular audio synthesis libraries for the browser, we'll transition to using the [Metasounds system in Unreal Engine 5](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/metasounds-in-unreal-engine/), which provides a full audio programming environment for procedural content and sound synthesis.

## (un)Grading

This course will be collaboratively graded (also known as "ungrading"). You will be asked to write short reflections on each assignment, and I will, in turn, provide feedback on both your work and your reflection. It is your responsibility to explain what you did in each assignment, what you learned, and how you spent your (valuable!) time. At the end of the course you will also turn in a reflection on your learning and an assessment of what grade you should receive, which I will respond to in order to determine a final grade in the course. *You won't be surprised at the grade you receive and will have detailed feedback throuhgout the course justifying it*.

The work itself will be a combination of weekly assignments and a longer (3-4 week) final project. It is expected that you spend roughly 10 hours a week outside of class time on course readings, assignments, and the final project.

## (more on) Office Hours

In addition to my in-person office hours, I will also spend time on Discord answering questions asynchronously. Whenever possible, please post questions *publicly* in Discord so everyone can learn from the answers... and there's a good chance someone else in the class might be able to help with technical questions as well. My in-person office hours are from 3--5 on Tuesday, in Fuller Labs B30... please stop by! Some good reasons to stop by in-person office hours include:

- We can't debug your problems over Discord
- Brainstorming on final project / assignment ideas
- You want to talk about audio / music / interactive programming more generally
- You're interested in learning more about [my](http://charlie-roberts.com) [research](https://repl-wpi.github.io)
- You want to tell me about your research / artistic practice
- You'd like to sit and work a bit with me/other students nearby in case questions popup (space permitting)
- Anything else, really!

If you need a longer block of time, it's probably best to schedule appointment with me outside of my drop-in office hours.

## Academic Integrity

I don't think there's a way to "cheat" in this class as it based on projects and creative work. However, collborative grading relies on your honesty; please take this into account when writing your reflections.
